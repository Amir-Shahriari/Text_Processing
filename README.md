## Overview

The **Text Processing Projects** repository showcases:

- Basic text processing tasks like tokenization and stemming.
- Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques including named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
- Analysis of n-grams and their frequencies.
- Implementation of TF-IDF for text similarity.

These projects are practical resources for exploring text processing techniques and understanding the underlying concepts of NLP.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Project Descriptions

### Simple Text Processing

The **Simple Text Processing** script provides functions for basic text analysis. Key features include:

- **Tokenization**: Split text into sentences and words.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Analyze the distribution of POS tags in questions and answers.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify named entities and compute their frequencies.
- **TF-IDF Similarity**: Compare questions and answers based on TF-IDF vectors.
- **Code Example**:

  ```python
  from Simple_Text_Processing import stats_pos, stats_ne, stats_tfidf
  pos_stats = stats_pos('data/sample.csv')
  print(pos_stats)
  ```

### Complex Text Processing

The **Complex Text Processing** notebook extends text analysis to more sophisticated tasks. Key features include:

- **N-grams Analysis**: Extract and analyze the most frequent n-grams.
- **Stemming**: Reduce words to their root forms for better analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visualize text statistics using plots and graphs.
- **Named Entity Frequency**: Compare entity distributions in different text sections.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in the scripts and notebooks)

## How to Use

1. Open the scripts or notebooks using a Python IDE or Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired file (`Simple_Text_Processing.py` or `Complex_Text_Processing.ipynb`).
3. Run the code step-by-step to execute the functions and observe the outputs.

Each file includes detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the implementation.
